### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a seasoned software developer and technical team lead with hands-on experience designing scalable backend systems, building APIs, implementing DevOps pipelines, and leading Agile teams across global projects. I love solving complex technical problems, mentoring teammates, and building systems that last.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to impactful projects at companies like **Accenture**, **Capgemini**, and currently in an operations and monitoring-focused role in London. I bring a balance of technical depth and team leadership, having served as a **Scrum Master**, **Team Lead**, and backend engineer across cloud-native and enterprise environments.
